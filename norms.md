--Our own:		
 - -    Try to use semicolons		
 - -    Adding comments, re-formating is okay		
 - -    If you change something major (changing file structure, removing routes, etc.), let the group know beforehand		
 - -		
 - -		
 - -		
 - -What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?		
 - -Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?		
 - -		
 - -    Everyone should voice their opinion but also explain why they want or don't want features, etc. present your case articulately with supporting reasons.		
 - -    The group should talk through disagreements as a whole		
 - -    If we really cannot come to an agreement, we can turn to our fellow		
 - -		
 - -		
 - -What does this group do when a member is frustrated?		
 - -What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.		
 - -		
 - -    For the person who is frustrated, ask yourself why. Ask what your group can do for you to help. 		
 - -    Differentiate between whether the frustration signals something that needs to change or if you are just exhausted.		
 - -		
 - -    If it is an issue between two members, they should try to resolve it between themselves. If that isn't possible, then it can become a problem the group can address		
 - -		
 - -    Watch your language- avoid "you do this, etc" do not use accusatory language. Instead say "this makes me...", "I can tell you're frustrated, why?..." Asking questions to understand the problem and do not make assumptions about the person		
 - -		
 - -		
 - -What does this group do when we merge our work together?		
 - -Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?		
 - -		
 - -    If a pair is working on a feature, have someone not in the pair review the pull request. Also in general, have another member review pull requests. Pull early and often		
 - -		
 - -When does this group ask for help?		
 - -After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?		
 - -		
 - -    After 15 minutes we can ask for help, however we should ask other team members for help before we ask a fellow/instructor. 		
 - -		
 - -    Strategies should include referring to previous lectures, workshops, documentation, stackoverflow, Google everything		
 - -		
 - -How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?		
 - -Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?		
 - -		
 - -    Members of pairs should follow this norms guideline. Timers are good idea, ~20 mins.		
 - -		
 - -    For a member(s) that is more comfortable with a concept, they should pair so that another member can learn from them instead of completing it on their own. Members that both feel confident in an area, should not pair together for that task. 		
 - -		
 - -How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?		
 - -Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?		
 - -		
 - -    If someone strongly wants to work on a certain part of the project, she should not feel afraid to step up and express interest in working on that aspect. 		
 - -		
 - -    Have open communication if we want to work on it after hours.		
 - -		
 - -What time does this group have daily stand up?		
 - -		
 - -    Mornings after REACTO
